    This is Pan, a powerful and user-friendly Usenet newsreader for GTK+.
    The latest info and versions of Pan can always be found at
    <http://pan.rebelbase.com/>.


RELEASE NOTES

        * Keep in mind that if you have been using the localhost server with an
          stunnel setup and you change Pan to connect directly to the server
          using the actual server address, you should edit the existing server
          instead of creating a new entry. If you create a new entry, Pan will
          see this as a new server entirely even though you may be connecting to
          the same account as before.
          Your subscribed groups will be lost!
          By editing the existing 'localhost:119' server entry, your
          subscriptions will be preserved.

        * To get SSL support in Pan, remember to run the following command:

          ./configure --with-gnutls

          If you are building Pan from the Git code repository, run the following
          command:

          sh autogen.sh --with-gnutls

        * Directories to search for SSL certificates can be defined with the
          environment variable 'SSL_CERT_DIR' or 'SSL_DIR'.

OBTAINING THE REQUIREMENTS

    Most Linux distributions make the libraries available as packages; you can
    also download the libraries directly from their home pages.

    On Debian-based systems (for example: Ubuntu), install the requirements
    with the following command:

    sudo apt-get install <REQUIREMENT>

    Alternatively, there is a PPA maintained by Klaus Vormweg that can be found at
    https://launchpad.net/~klaus-vormweg/+archive/pan

    On Fedora-based systems, run the following command to install the
    requirements:

    sudo yum install -y <REQUIREMENT>

    On Arch Linux, run the following command to invoke the package manager Pacman:

    sudo pacman -S <REQUIREMENT>


THE SALES PITCH

    Pan is good for Reading News.

        * Pan is the only Unix newsreader to score 100% on the
          Good Net-Keeping Seal of Approval newsreader evaluations.
        * Pan has keyboard bindings for mouse-free newsreading.
        * Basic newsreader features, such as reading and writing news,
          threading articles, and replying via email, are supported.
        * Articles can be sorted by author, date, subject, or the number
          of unread children in the thread.
        * Multiple connections are supported, so articles can be read
          while binaries are downloading.
        * Articles can be filtered by regular expression matching,
          read/unread state, binary/text, etc.
        * Works well as an offline reader.
        * Articles can be queued until you want to go online, and can be
          re-edited at any point before they're posted.
        * A flexible rules system allows you to delete, hide, download,
          or notify you of, etc. articles that match a subject, or are
          posted by a particular user, and so on.
        * The same system can be used to define automatic actions on behalf
          of the user: auto-download, auto-cache, auto-delete etc.
        * Groups can be filtered by regular expression matching
          subscribed/new/all, etc.

    Pan is good for Downloading Binaries.

        * Attached images can be shown inline.
        * Pan can download and thread articles as quickly as bandwidth allows.
        * uuencoded, mime, and yEnc attachments are all supported.
        * A task manager lets you reorder, cancel, and resubmit download tasks.
        * Multiple connections are supported, so many binaries can
          be downloaded simultaneously.
        * Multipart articles are automatically grouped together.
        * Non-binary, incomplete multipart, and saved messages can be filtered
          out of the article list.

    Pan is good for Uploading Content to Usenet.

        * Files can be attached to a Usenet article and are
          automatically yEnc-encrypted, threaded and referenced by Pan.
        * Articles can be encrypted and/or signed with a public/private PGP key,
          so your privacy and security are ensured.
        * Connections can be encrypted with the TLS 1.0 protocol (the successor
          to SSL 3.0).
